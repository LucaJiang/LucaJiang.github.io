The Chinese Version of readme, see here. Content Background Method Result MATLAB Code BackgroundMedical images often have regions of interest marked by doctors. Generally speaking, before building a deep learning model, we need to manually select these areas, which is time-consuming and may introduce extra errors. This repo proposes a graphics-based method to select these areas automatically. Take this thyroid ultrasound(US) image for example. The black shadow in the middle is a thyroid nodule. The thin white box around it is a mark. We need to obtain images of areas deemed valuable by doctors and build models based on those areas. If the gray scale of the white box is stable. For example, it is a fixed value. We can easily locate the white box through a computer program. Unfortunately, in most cases, the gray scale would be affected by the background color. We generally use hough transform to detect straight lines. However, medical images often have interference elements. For example, in this case, the dividing line between the skin and muscles of the neck could be easily misjudged by the computer as part of the white box. That’s why hough transform can not be applied directly. Besides, to be honest, manual processing of this kind of images is also very laborious. Because the line is too thin. To sum up, it is difficult to detect white rectangle mark in medical images. And I failed to find a suitable way to deal with such problem on the internet or papers. So I try my best to propose my own ideas on it. In the following sections, I propose a method based on morphological operations and hough transform. BTW, I suggest that you should check it yourself after processing. Although this program works well, it could fail in some special cases. MethodIn order to apply hough transform, we need to separate white line from interference background. So, firstly, we apply morphological opening on the gray scale images. The morphological open operation is an erosion followed by a dilation, using the same structuring element for both operations. For more details, see here. Then, we can easily detect the mark in current situation (see the middle row of result). Here, I apply hough transform, but you can use whatever you want. The theory of hough transform can be found here. The core MATLAB codes of this process are 1234567891011121314151617% get gray scale imagesimg = rgb2gray(ori_img);% morphological operationsbackground = imopen(img, strel(&#x27;disk&#x27;, disk_size));sub = imsubtract(img, background);ind = sub &gt;= min_sub;imshow(ind)% hough transform[n, m] = size(ind);[H,T,R] = hough(ind);P = houghpeaks(H, 4, &#x27;threshold&#x27;, ceil(0.2*max(H(:))));lines = houghlines(ind, T, R, P, &#x27;FillGap&#x27;, FillGap_value,&#x27;MinLength&#x27;, MinLength_value);% cropping along lines... ResultThe results show as follows. CodeMATLAB code available at here. NoteThe processing of locating the point after the Hough transform could be improved. Insert try-catch exception module, for instance. But the current processing effect has reached my requirements.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"image processing","slug":"image-processing","permalink":"https://lucajiang.github.io/tags/image-processing/"}]},{"title":"My First Article","slug":"My-First-Article","date":"2020-11-04T13:05:45.000Z","updated":"2020-11-05T06:15:35.354Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/04/My-First-Article/","link":"","permalink":"https://lucajiang.github.io/2020/11/04/My-First-Article/","excerpt":"","text":"HELLO~","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2020-11-04T11:45:46.257Z","updated":"2020-11-05T06:15:03.425Z","comments":true,"path":"2020/11/04/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"https://lucajiang.github.io/2020/11/04/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"This article is rewrite based on Hexo’s Hello world post.
